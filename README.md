Convertor wav to mp4

This script came from the necessity of uploading some audios to YouTube for easy access for more people.
Of course, I needed all audios (about 80) to be in video format.

I found out about Ffmpeg and so I installed it and put together a python script to help me automate the process.
Hope you will find it useful!

example of running the script: python3 convertor.py

disclaimer: you need to install Ffmpeg prior to using this script
